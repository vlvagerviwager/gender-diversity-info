## About the maintainer

Building empathy for every single being and situation in our world is a lifelong mission for me. Being a gender and racial minority in my industry, an activist for the right to bodily autonomy, and a volunteer in outreach programs, I did not realise that I could use my experience and voice to help others until I embarked on my quest to learn more about diversity.
